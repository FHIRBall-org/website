## Summary
Continued work on replicating the FHIRBall website (https://www.fhirball.org) layout, content, and styling using Astro framework with Tailwind CSS.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Homepage "Become a Member" Section Styling

- Tests in `tests/unit/`
- 44 tests validating member content and CSS classes

**Playwright (E2E Tests):**
- Configuration in `playwright.config.ts`
- Tests in `tests/e2e/`
- 23 tests covering homepage, members page, search page, contact form, and thank-you page

**Test Scripts Added:**
```bash
npm test          # Vitest watch mode
npm run test:unit # Vitest single run
npm run test:e2e  # Playwright tests
npm run test:e2e:ui # Playwright with UI
npm run test:all  # Both unit and E2E
```

### 8. Contact Form - Netlify Forms Integration
Migrated contact form from Netlify Forms placeholder to working implementation:

- Added `data-netlify="true"` attribute for form detection
- Added honeypot field (`bot-field`) for spam protection
- Created `public/form.html` - static form for Netlify build-time detection
- Created `/thank-you` page for post-submission redirect
- Form submissions stored in Netlify dashboard with email notification support

### 9. Netlify Deployment Configuration
Created `netlify.toml` with:
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- Node.js version: 20
- Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy)
- Cache headers for static assets (images, CSS, JS)

### 10. Documentation
Created comprehensive `README.md` including:
- Tech stack overview
- Getting started / development instructions

## Notes
- Webflow CSS from original site doesn't always match rendered output due to conflicting styles
- All styling now uses either CSS classes in `global.css` or Tailwind utility classes
- No inline `style=` attributes remain in any pages, components, or layouts
- Netlify Forms requires a static HTML form file for detection with Astro builds
- Site successfully deployed to Netlify with working contact form
