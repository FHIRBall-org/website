# Development Log - February 11, 2026

## Summary
Fixed member detail page layout and styling, updated member content to match Webflow site rendering, and aligned homepage hero and "Who we are" sections with Webflow visual output. Fixed critical CSS cascade issue where base typography in `global.css` was overriding Tailwind utility classes.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Member Detail Page Layout Fix
- Fixed logo/contact info overlap by switching from `max-width` to `width` for flex columns
- Logo column: `md:w-[30%] shrink-0` with `max-w-[400px] h-[200px]`
- Contact info: `md:ml-auto md:w-auto` for right-alignment
- Bottom 3-column row: `md:w-1/3` with `gap-4`

### 2. Member Detail Page Tailwind Migration
Replaced custom CSS classes with Tailwind utility classes:
- Container: `max-w-[1200px] mx-auto text-[16px] leading-normal`
- Contact labels: `whitespace-nowrap` (was `member-contact-label`)
- Contact values: `font-semibold` (was `member-contact-value`)
- Bio: `text-[18px] text-text leading-relaxed` with `member-bio` class for markdown scoping
- List items: `font-medium mb-0 text-text` (was `member-list-item`)
- Articles: `[&_a]:text-text [&_a]:font-bold [&_a:hover]:underline` (was `member-articles`)

### 3. Member Content Updates
Updated 11 of 13 member markdown files to match Webflow site content verbatim:
- 1upHealth, AaNeel, Beda, CSIRO, Firely, Health Samurai, HealthLX, Hike Health, Onyx, Smile Digital Health, Trisotech

### 4. Certifications Feature
- Added `certifications` field (string array) to content schema in `content.config.ts`
- Added `memberArticles` field (object array) to content schema
- Moved certification data from markdown body to frontmatter for 1upHealth and Onyx
- Added certifications rendering in member detail template

### 5. Homepage "Who we are" Section
- Heading: added `uppercase` class to match Webflow rendering
- Body text: set to `text-[18px] text-text leading-[28px]`

### 6. Homepage Hero Section
- Headline: `lg:text-[72px]` (confirmed by visual comparison with Webflow)
- HIMSS/FHIRBall Pavilion line: increased from default ~16px to `text-[20px] md:text-[24px] lg:text-[26px]` with `leading-[46px]` and `mt-14`
- Container: `max-w-[1200px] mx-auto px-[10px]` to align left edge with header logo

### 7. Critical CSS Fix: Base Typography Layer
**Problem:** Base typography rules in `global.css` (h1-h4, body, p) were unlayered, causing them to always override Tailwind utility classes. In CSS cascade layers, unlayered styles beat `@layer utilities`.

**Fix:** Wrapped all base typography rules in `@layer base` so Tailwind's `@layer utilities` can properly override them when utility classes are applied.

**Impact:** This was preventing ALL Tailwind font-size classes on heading elements from taking effect across the entire site.

## Key Learnings
- **Webflow CSS collisions:** The Webflow site's CSS has conflicting rules that don't match rendered output. Always match the VISUAL RENDERING, not the CSS values.
- **CSS cascade layers:** In Tailwind CSS v4, base styles in `global.css` MUST be wrapped in `@layer base` for Tailwind utility classes to override them. Unlayered styles always win over layered styles.
- **Use Tailwind utilities over global.css:** Only use `global.css` for things that can't be expressed as Tailwind utilities (background images, line-heights on custom classes, markdown content scoping).

### 8. Resources/Blog Pages
Added the Resources section, migrating 9 blog articles from the Webflow site.

**Content:**
- Extracted and created 9 article markdown files from `www.fhirball.org/post/*.html`
- Deleted placeholder `welcome.md` article
- Articles use existing `articles` content collection schema (no changes needed)

**Pages:**
- `src/pages/resources/index.astro` — Listing page with hero banner, external resource links (FHIR Standard, HL7 International, HIMSS, FHIR Cheat Sheet), and article card grid
- `src/pages/resources/[slug].astro` — Detail page with dark hero, markdown content, related posts section
- Deleted old `src/pages/articles/` pages (were never linked from nav)

**Component:**
- Updated `ArticleCard.astro` — added `author` prop, changed URLs from `/articles/` to `/resources/`, removed date display

**Styling:**
- Added `.article-content` scoped prose styles in `global.css` for markdown rendering (18px body text, link colors, list spacing)

**Tests:**
- Created `tests/e2e/resources.spec.ts` — listing page and detail page E2E tests
- Added article content validation to `tests/unit/content.test.ts`

**Articles migrated:**
1. The FHIR Business Alliance (FHIRBall) Is Focused on Business Use Cases
2. AaNeel InfoTech Joins FHIRBall Alliance to Advance FHIR-Based Interoperability
3. Do Business the FHIR way — with the FHIR Business Alliance (FHIRBall)
