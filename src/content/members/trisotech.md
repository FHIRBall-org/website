Trisotech is a decision-centric orchestration platform that enables healthcare organizations to explicitly define, govern, and execute clinical and administrative logic through visual, standards-based models. Built on BPM+ (DMN, BPMN, CMMN, SDMN) standards and natively integrated with FHIR, SMART on FHIR, and CDS Hooks, Trisotech delivers interoperable healthcare automation that is portable across EHR environments and provides end-to-end traceability. AI can be leveraged within these orchestrations as trusted AI, under explicit constraints and governance, ensuring that outcomes remain transparent, reviewable, and accountable to human decision makers.

From day one, clinical leaders gain visibility into how care decisions are structured, executed, and governed across pathways and systems.
