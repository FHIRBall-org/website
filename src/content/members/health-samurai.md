Health Samurai aims to revolutionize care delivery through quality software and an open, connected healthcare ecosystem. The organization has championed FHIR since its inception and developed the Aidbox platform in 2015, combining FHIR with engineering excellence.

This platform powers numerous cloud-based EHR systems, telemedicine solutions, care coordination platforms, patient applications, and analytics products.
