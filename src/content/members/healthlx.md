HealthLX focuses on healthcare interoperability with the goal to remove data complexity and turn regulatory requirements into long-term strategic advantage.

We normalize, map, and standardize healthcare data using a canonical FHIR-based architecture that works with existing systems. From CMS-mandated APIs and fully electronic prior authorization to HIE data quality and member-directed exchange, HealthLX enables organizations to achieve compliance quickly, reduce integration costs, and unlock new digital capabilities.

By delivering clean, real-time, reusable data across payers, providers, HIEs, and members, we help healthcare organizations move faster today while building a future-ready foundation for innovation, growth, and improved patient outcomes.
