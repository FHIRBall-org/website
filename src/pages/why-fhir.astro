        FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a data standard that allows better access to health information.
      </p>

      <h2>What is FHIR?</h2>
      <p>
        FHIR is a standard developed by HL7 International for exchanging healthcare information electronically. It combines the best features of previous HL7 standards with modern web technologies.

        <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Enables seamless data exchange between different healthcare systems</li>
        <li><strong>Modern Architecture:</strong> Built on RESTful APIs and modern web standards</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Supports a wide range of healthcare use cases</li>
