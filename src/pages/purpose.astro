        The FHIR Business Alliance (FHIRBall) is a global partnership co-founded by <a href="/members" class="text-primary font-semibold hover:text-primary-hover">1upHealth</a>, <a href="/members" class="text-primary font-semibold hover:text-primary-hover">AEGIS</a>, <a href="/members" class="text-primary font-semibold hover:text-primary-hover">Firely</a>, and <a href="/members" class="text-primary font-semibold hover:text-primary-hover">Smile Digital Health</a>. Our companies have been heavily involved with HL7® FHIR® (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) since its beginning. We all believe FHIR is driving major changes in health IT and, in turn, driving progress in healthcare by enabling true interoperability through standard, safe and efficient APIs. Our purpose as FHIRBall is to expand FHIR knowledge, spread awareness about health interoperability and build more interoperable FHIR solutions around the world.
      </p>
      <p class="text-[18px] leading-[28px] text-text mt-4">
        Together, we join forces to expand the market for FHIR products and services, as well as FHIR-based tools and solutions. Why? Because we believe every patient and healthcare worker deserves the best that technology has to offer. By spreading FHIR, we can enable openness and better collaboration within the healthcare industry.
      </p>
      <p class="text-[18px] leading-[28px] text-text mt-4">
        Through each of our businesses, we strive to propel the healthcare industry forward through the community-based approach of HL7 and the FHIR Foundation.
